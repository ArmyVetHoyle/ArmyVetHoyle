- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArmyVetHoyle
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to become more proficient with computers and technology. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build Android Apps and using Kotlin. I am also about to start my 4 year degree in Computer Science from Oregon State University in June.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate as I am still learning a great deal into this word.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email is WRHoyle92@GMail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: No offense, but I do not believe in these nor do I use them. I am a male at birth and believe in only 2 genders. Please respect my decision.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I served 4 years in the United States Army, and I had one deployment to Afghanistan.
